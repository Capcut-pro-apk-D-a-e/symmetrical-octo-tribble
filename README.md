## About

**Symmetrical Octo Tribble** is a project that tackles the idea of symmetries in nature and mathematics through the lens of fictional creatures. The "octo-tribble" combines the infinite adorableness of a tribble with the mysterious and complex structure of an octopus, all while exploring symmetrical patterns and shapes.

This project uses geometric algorithms to generate symmetries, analyze shapes, and simulate the "tribble" effect — small, infinitely multiplying shapes that are as cute as they are perplexing. Whether you're into fractals, symmetry group theory, or just like watching things multiply, **Symmetrical Octo Tribble** is the perfect way to explore these concepts in a whimsical way.

## Features

- **Symmetry Generation:** Automatically generate symmetrical octagonal or other geometric patterns.
- **Fractal Tribble Multiplication:** Watch as octo-tribbles multiply in fun and fascinating ways.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Explore different symmetrical and fractal patterns interactively, allowing you to zoom, rotate, and explore geometric spaces.
- **Algorithmic Art:** Leverage algorithms to create visually stunning patterns and art, based on mathematical principles of symmetry.
- **Customizable Patterns:** Tailor the complexity, color schemes, and symmetry axes to your liking.
